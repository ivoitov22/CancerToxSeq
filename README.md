# UW Biology Data Visualization Project

This repository contains the **University of Washington project** I completed with [Professor’s Name], focusing on **visualizing and analyzing biological datasets**. The project integrates datasets from multiple tissues and organs with web-based visualization tools.

> **Note:** Many of the pages in this repository are dummy placeholders in this commit, as I no longer have access to the original final files. The file `realindex.php` represents how the main project page would have looked.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to:

- Process biological datasets for multiple tissue types.
- Generate interactive visualizations using **JavaScript (Chart.js)**.
- Provide web interfaces for data submission and visualization using **PHP and HTML**.
- Enable exploration of tissue-specific patterns and comparisons across datasets.

## Datasets

The project includes CSV datasets for different tissues:

- `BoneMarrow.csv` – Bone marrow data  
- `Cortex.csv` – Cortex tissue data  
- `DRG.csv` – Dorsal Root Ganglia data  
- `Fat.csv` – Fat tissue data  
- `Heart.csv` – Heart tissue data  
- `Hypothalamus.csv` – Hypothalamus data  
- `Kidneys.csv` – Kidney tissue data  
- `Muscle.csv` – Muscle tissue data

## Tools & Technologies

- **HTML / CSS / PHP** – Web interface and server-side data handling  
- **JavaScript (Chart.js)** – Interactive charts and data visualization  
- **CSV files** – Raw biological datasets  
- **Images** – Graphs and visual summaries
